### Why are 32 bit applications missing?
With the choice to keep the repositories limited in size, the choice was made not to include any 32 bit only application. Reason behind that is two-fold.

It is a good eighteen years now that 64 bit is available. Any software that chooses to ignore advances in hardware for such a long time does not make the cut KaOS has set for quality standards. What other improvements have been ignored in what is an eternity in technology time span?

Basically there are just a handful of such applications left (Android-sdk, Wine and Steam are the best known), but to package those means packaging a good 150-200 support packages, including a full toolchain, for just those 3-5 applications.
