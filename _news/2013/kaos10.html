    Oops...
    Thanks for noticing, corrected.

<p>Bi-weekly did not work for this release, updates/rebuilds to systemd/toolchain/util-linux among many other core packages, changed a lot of how the live system started all the needed services.  About 25 ISO builds were needed to get all working as before again.</p>
<p>After the October 1st release, many users came with suggestions/requests to add certain applications.  Most of these were added over the last weeks. Examples vokoscreen, virtualbox, mkvtoolnix, handbrake. Expect a few more request to be filled soon (engineering applications for one, probably 4-5 of the more well known games too).  End goal is  around 2000-2200 packages in the repositories, no more.<br />
A full switch to plasma-nm from networkmanager-applet is implemented in this release.  Also added to the repo is a very early preview/release of qsystemd, a Qt5/qml GUI frontend for systemd services.<a href="http://kaosx.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/qsystemd.png"><img src="http://kaosx.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/qsystemd-300x168.png" alt="qsystemd" width="300" height="168" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-808" /></a></p>
<p>This ISO will be the last of the twice a months snapshot, with the release of KDE 4.11.3 early November, KaOS will go for a public release and be submitted to DistroWatch, from then on expect new releases closely tied to KDE updates (every 4-6 weeks a new ISO, so new users are never faced with a complicated first pacman -Syu).  Existing users will always have the latest, no need to reinstall, just update regularly.</p>
