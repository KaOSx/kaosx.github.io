<p>Trying to work out the best update model for the different repo's is starting to take shape for core and main. &nbsp;There will be two kernels in use, one stable, well-tested, only available once a new major release reaches 3.x.8 or above, the unstable kernel is linux-next, and is fully following upstream releases. &nbsp;This way, linux-next will be an excellent test ground for the next stable release.</p>
<p>KDE has made 4.11 pre-releases available, and after testing those for 3 weeks, there are no issues to stop from moving to 4.11 early, 4.10.90 has moved to the stable repo's.</p>
