<p>KaOS has stayed with libpng 1.5 for as long as possible (and while that version was still fully maintained).<br />
With 1.5.22 it seems maintenance has come to an end so there is no choice but to move to 1.6.<br />
Libpng effects virtually all applications in the KaOS repositories so a large rebuild was needed (poppler was also effected, thus updated, which also triggered a rebuild of all depending on poppler).</p>
<p>With your next update you will receive this libpng change.<br />
Reason to make this a news time though is this update will break most of your applications you build yourself (KCP or otherwise not from the KaOS repositories).  Make sure to rebuild your non-repo packages depending on libpng after this update.</p>
