<p>With the move of <a class="fancybox-iframe" title="kde 4.12.2" href="http://www.kde.org/announcements/announce-4.12.2.php"> KDE 4.12.2</a> to the stable repo, it is a good time to give a status update of KaOS. Moved today is not just KDE 4.12.2, but also a major update, <strong>libgcrypt</strong>. Much was rebuild for this, plus other lower level libs will be included in your next pacman -Syu. Firefox 27.0, Thunderbird 24.3.0, Chrome 34 (first release with aura) are among the updates too. In all, a good 540 packages are moved to stable today. You will be asked about a few replaces, answer all with "Yes".</p>
<p>January did see well over 4000 downloads of KaOS, with that, many more users have become interested in participating in this distribution. With that interest, a new option was added, <a title="KCP" href="https://github.com/KaOS-Community-Packages"><strong>KaOS Community Packages</strong></a> (<strong>KCP</strong>). This gives all users the ability to participate in making missing packages (not in the KaOS repositories) available through downloadable PKGBUILD files. See the <a href="http://kaosx.us/kcp-guide/">KCP Guide</a> for detailed instructions. Github is used for this, it gives a very flexible and powerful front-end, full history of any change to any package available, easy discussion with the integrated "issue" options.<br />

The influx of new users also brought request for many new and interesting packages, in all a good fifty were added, which makes the repositories stand at about 1950. Among those added Qgis, Eclipse, Dianara, Synaptiks, Krusader, Qlandkartegt, Truecrypt, Icedtea-Web and Grass.</p>
<p>A special mention is needed for the addition of <strong>Lightworks</strong>, a professional video editing suite, which release has been highly anticipated for over 3 years. The first stable release for Linux does not disappoint offering great stability, speed and intuitive work-flow. <a href="http://kaosx.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/qgis_kaos.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1158" src="http://kaosx.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/qgis_kaos-300x187.png" alt="qgis_kaos" width="300" height="187" /></a></p>
<p>To accommodate hardware from about 2005 through 2008 that does not fully work with the latest kernels, and give users the ability to choose even more stability in their kernel selection, <strong>linux-lts</strong> was added to the repository. The current linux-lts follows the <strong>3.2 series</strong>, which is used in Debian Wheezy and will be maintained upstream through 2016. See this <a title="adding linux-next or linux-lts" href="http://kaosx.us/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=69">tutorial for instructions</a> how to add an extra kernel.<br />
<a href="http://kaosx.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/snapshot30.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1161" src="http://kaosx.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/snapshot30-300x198.png" alt="octopi" width="300" height="198" /></a><br />
<strong>Octopi</strong> had two more features added, one makes updating the system possible with just one click on the newly added update button, a longer requested, and for a rolling distribution <strong>vital feature is that mirror checking</strong> is fully integrated. Any time you start Octopi, it will give you a status of your used mirror, plus you can re-check with a click on a button.</p>
