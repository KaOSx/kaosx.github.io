<p>Two weeks into the New Year, KaOS is pleased to present you with a first ISO for 2014. The policy is, once a first pacman -Syu becomes a major update, it is time for a new ISO so new users are not faced with a difficult first update. Since the last ISO, updates to a good 700 packages happened, including some major groups, so a new ISO is now needed.<a href="http://kaosx.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/snapshot5.png"><img src="http://kaosx.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/snapshot5-300x187.png" alt="snapshot5" width="300" height="187" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1131" /></a></p>
<p>Among the updates, you will find <a class="fancybox-iframe" href="http://kde.org/announcements/announce-4.12.1.php" title="kde 4.12.1"> KDE 4.12.1</a>, new mkinitcpio and kmod. LLVM, ilmbase and openexr, libwebp all had a .so update, meaning all those that depend on them were rebuild. Another large group is the new xorg stack, with <strong>xorg 1.15, mesa 10.0.2</strong>. New options were added to this group including dri3proto, libxshmfence and presentproto.</p>
<p>Visually the biggest change for this ISO is the move to <strong>homerun-kicker</strong>.  Plus Octopi has moved to Qt5 and has the option added to show file listing for all packages, not just installed.</p>
<p>For further info about the ISO please see <a class="fancybox-iframe" href="http://kaosx.us/RELEASE_NOTES_20140117.html" title="release notes">the release notes</a> and the <a href="http://kaosx.us/download/" title="Download">Download</a> page.</p>
