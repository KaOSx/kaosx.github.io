<h3>Installing the needed packages</h3></p>
<p>First, you'll need as a minimum cups. If you haven't it already installed, do it (with pacman):<br />
<code>sudo pacman -Syu</code><br />
<code>sudo pacman -S cups</code><br />
For many printers, this is not enough. Packages to add (and try) are:<br />
<code>sudo pacman -S gutenprint system-config-printer cups-pdf</code><br />
To have a printer entry in system-settings:<br />
<code>sudo pacman -S print-manager</code><br />
Epson printer specific (again not all will need this step) add:<br />
<code>sudo pacman -S epson-inkjet-printer-escpr</code><br />
And lastly, some printers will need the foomatic-filters package.<br />
<code>sudo pacman -S foomatic-filters</code></p>
<h3>Starting the printer installation</h3></p>
<p>Once all is installed, <strong>start cups</strong> with:<br />
<code>sudo systemctl start org.cups.cupsd.socket</code><br />
To make this auto-start on each boot:<br />
<code>sudo systemctl enable org.cups.cupsd.socket</code><br />
If you are using a Hewlett-Packard printer, you'll need also hplip, so install it too in that case:<br />
<code>sudo pacman -S hplip</code><br />
You might notice after installing hplip, there is mention of "optdepends". To get all features for hplip that you possibly can get, install all optdepends:</p>
<blockquote><p>dbus-python2, for dbus support<br />
sane, for scanner support<br />
rpcbind: for network support<br /></blockquote></p>
<p>Now you can open <strong><a href="http://localhost:631">http://localhost:631</a></strong> and add your printer to CUPS.  One note about log in, the name is actually <strong>"root"</strong> (without quotes), not your root username.</p>
<h3>Troubleshooting</h3></p>
<p><strong>Epson-multi-functional printers</strong><br />
When installing all the above mentioned packages does not result in cups recognizing your Epson printer, there is a chance that sane blocks this. To correct this issue, create a udev-rule for usb-printers as root, including a scanner entry called /etc/udev/rules.d/10-usbprinter.rules, with the following content:<br />
<code>ATTR{idVendor}=="04b8", ATTR{idProduct}=="0851", MODE:="0660", GROUP:="lp" ENV{libsane_matched}:="yes"</code><br />
To get the needed idVendor and idProduct run:<br />
<code>lsusb</code><br />
and look for the Epson printer line, example:<br />
<code>Bus 001 Device 004: ID 04b8:0851 Seiko Epson Corp. Stylus SX410</code><br />
Were the first ID number is idVendor, second is idProduct.<br />
Just having sane installed is not enough to get the scanner fuction to work for these devices. Easy solution is to edit /etc/sane.d/epson2.conf as root, uncomment the last (usb) line:</p>
<blockquote><p># For libusb support for unknown scanners use the following command<br />
# usb
<product ID> <device ID><br />
# e.g.:<br />
#usb 04b8 0851</blockquote></p>
<p>And again use the correct idVendor and idProduct number for your device. Install skanlite with<br />
<code>sudo pacman -S skanlite</code><br />
to have an easy GUI for scanning.</p>
<h3>Extra Troubleshooting for scanning with Epson Stylus cx 5600</h3></p>
<p>/etc/sane.d/epson2.conf stays the same as in example above<br />
/etc/sane.d/epson.conf comment all lines</p>
<p>in /etc/sane.d/dll.conf uncomment the line epson2 all other lines remains commented</p>
<h3>Troubleshooting Samsung Printers</h3></p>
<p>If the installed printer packages do not result in a working Samsung printer you probably will need to get the proprietary Samsung driver</p>
<p>Go here: <a href="http://www.samsungdrivers.net/samsung-ml-2160-driver/">http://www.samsungdrivers.net/samsung-ml-2160-driver/</a> and download linux unified driver, the driver archive is named:</p>
<p><code>UnifiedLinuxDriver_1.01.tar.gz</code></p>
<p>Copy this archive to /home/user/Downloads and extract there.<br />
"user" is your username of your KaOS install.</p>
<p>Then open a terminal and type:</p>
<p><code>sudo /home/user/Downloads/cdroot/autorun</code></p>
<p>Follow the instructions to have a fully working Samsung printer.</p>
