**hardware video acceleration**

The video card can decode/encode video and render KDE Plasma effects. It reduces CPU usage and save power. Hardware video acceleration does not work out of the box. This short tutorial focus on VA-API, which is the  most commonly used method for Intel and AMD/ATI GPUs.

The built-in kernel modesetting driver might provide direct rendering (DRI2 and DRI3) out of the box via the Glamor accelmethod. To check it, run:

```
$ cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log|grep DRI

```
If you don't see any driver name (iHD, i965, radeonsi) then DRI is not working and you need to install media-driver. If you see problems when playing videos with Intel graphics then remove media-driver and install libva-intel-driver.

To verify if VA-API works, install libva-utils and run:

```
$ vainfo
```

It should return the name of the driver and the supported codecs like MPEG2, H264, VP8, ...

Sometimes only DRI2 works. To check DRI3, run:
```
$ LIBGL_DEBUG=verbose glxinfo | grep libgl
```
