Due to the file system used for compressing the KaOS ISO, creating a bootable DVD ISO needs one clear warning. **Any burn-speed used above 4x will likely result in an unusable DVD**. On virtual all Linux Distributions, this is no issue.

[ImgBurn](http://www.imgburn.com/index.php?act=download){: .button-link .button}

The native Windows ISO burn program does not give you the option to set at 4x. There are several free options available though for Windows, ImgBurn is one of them.
