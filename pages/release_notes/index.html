            <h3>KaOS - 2022.10</h3>
            <p>It is with great pleasure to present to you the October release of a new stable ISO.</p>

            <p>Many changes have been implemented to the installer <strong>Calamares</strong> in the last few months, so it is fitting to start with listing all that is new or has changed.</br>
            It is now possible to do a typical install entirely from a touchpad or mouse, a keyboard is no longer needed. A <strong>virtual keyboard</strong> has been implemented for those modules that need text input.</br>
            For those who prefer PulseAudio over Pipewire, a module has been added (KaOS only), that gives users the option to select which sound server they prefer (with Pipewire set as default).</br>
            <strong>Dracutis the new default</strong>  for the initramfs image creation (mkinitcpio is no longer in use for new installs). To accommodate that change, the Dracut module in Calamares had to be adjusted, so it now supports version-less kernels.</br>
            The slideshow presented during the install had a complete overhaul, no  longer in use are complete different images for each slide, now it has one static background and animated text sliding & fading in & out. Corresponding images for each text are now fading in as slides too. Less jarring transition as was before, so now it is no longer needed to mouse click to advance the slides, it loops automatically.</br>
            There now also is an option to either view the slideshow with information about the distribution or watch what the installer Calamares is currently doing by selecting the Log View.</br>
            The layout has also been adjusted, so it is now more intuitive to move through the steps and is more in line visually with the other KaOS application presented in Live mode and first boot into the new system. Gone is the use of a ComboBox in the different modules, Drawer is in use instead (for a more consistent behavior).</p>

            <p>As mentioned above, KaOS has moved to Dracut as the <strong>new initramfs infrastructure</strong>. Unlike other implementations, Dracut hard-codes as little as possible into the initramfs. The initramfs has (basically) one purpose in life -- getting the rootfs mounted so that transitioning to the real rootfs can be done. Dracut is distribution agnostic and used by many (examples Fedora, VOID, OpenSuse, Gentoo), plus the code-base is very actively maintained.</p>
            
            <p>With Dracut in place, the move to include <strong>ZFS as a new filesystem option</strong> could also be implemented. Using ZFS has been a goal for KaOS, ever since it started in 2013.  ZFS is not default at this stage since it cannot be used (yet) for BIOS installs.  For UEFI installs, <strong>only the systemd-boot bootloader</strong> is ready for ZFS. rEfind adaptation needs to be done still.</p>

            <p>For the Plasma desktop, the latest Plasma (5.25.90), KDE Gear (22.08.1), and Frameworks (5.78.0) are included. All built on <b>Qt 5.15.6+</b>. Among the changes included in Plasma 5.25.90 is improved Wayland support with the possibilty to select if apps will be scaled by the compositor or by themselves to avoid having blurry apps on Wayland.</p>
            
            <p><strong>kcp</strong>, the tool to help to manage Community packages, received a small update to list broken depends.
            This was needed to make it possible to do a full rewriting of [KCP-Center](https://kaos-community-packages.github.io) (the online Community packages viewer).  
            The backend of KCP-Center to update the database, <strong>whelp</strong>, was obsolete since Python2 was removed from the KaOS repositories.
            Plus it took too long to update the database. It has been simplified to directly use the kcp features to get the database and is now Python3-compatible.  
            The frontend was rewritten too, removing jQuery depends and unmaintained jQuery Plugins, and using the Mithril framework - https://mithril.js.org to create dynamic pages.</p>
            
            <p>Updates to the base of this distribution included Gawk 5.2.0, Bash 5.2, kernel moved to Linux 5.19.13, Systemd 251.5, DBus 1.14.4, Git 2.38.0, Mesa 22.1.7, Texlive packages moved to 2022, Openssh 9.1.P1, Libssh 0.10.4, and ZFS 2.1.6.</p>
            
            <p>A shift has started as to how all Python packages are built.  Historically, just about all were built with setuptools through a setup.py script.  PEP17 is the new standard for building python packages, see https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/.  At this stage, KaOS is testing this transition with different new Python build tools, such as Python-flit & Python-build, with Python-wheel currently in use to install the build packages.</p>

            <p>Qt 5.15 does not receive updates or maintenance from the Qt company (only closed source, paid support is available). KDE has stepped up though and published a maintained 5.15 fork https://dot.kde.org/2021/04/06/announcing-kdes-qt-5-patch-collection. KaOS now regularly does a patch update from this fork for all of Qt 5.15, so it basically is now at 5.15.7.
            </p>
            
            <p>For Nvidia, a new longterm support version is included in this ISO, 470xx. The move by Nvidia to 495 meant the end of support for Kepler based cards, thus the need to add a new legacy version.</p>
            
            <p>Qt 6.4.0 is included and is now far more complete since many more are ported from Qt5, this includes qt6-location and the big one, qt6-webengine (plus all the Qt6 webengine depends on). A few test applications have been build on qt6-webengine, including some web-browsers. Latest applications that are now using Qt6 are Obs-studio & Avidemux. Plus the Kvantum theming has support for Qt6.</p>

    <p>Big thanks goes to <strong>Fosshost</strong> for not only providing the default mirror (through the <strong>Fastly CDN</strong> mirror network) but also providing a server for KaOS. This server is replacing an eight-year-old server (used for package upload, ZNC bouncer, and the old PHP based package viewer).</p>
    
    <p>Since LibreOffice 6.2, it is now possible to supply this as a pure Qt5/kf5 application.  LibreOffice has thus replaced Calligra as the default Office Application for KaOS.</p>
    
    <p>KaOS' creation <strong>Croeso</strong> (Welsh for welcome) for helping with configuring a new install is included.  It will run on the newly installed system and offers to adjust some 15 commonly used settings, includes a custom Wallpaper selector, distribution info and the option to select packages to install from six different groups.  It is written in QML and fits well with the Welcome application used in the Live system.  The latter includes an Installation Guide.</p>
        
    <p>There is an option to verify the authenticity of downloaded KaOS ISO files through GPG signature verification, see the Download page for further details and instructions.</p>
    
    <p>A KaOS specific tool to write ISO files to USB is in use.  Not only does IsoWriter write to USB it also gives the option to recover your USB stick after using it for an ISO, something that regular dd copy or the previously used Imagewriter were not able to do. It includes the option to verify the written USB in comparison to the used ISO file.</p>
    
    <p>The artwork includes custom icon themes for light and dark themes. Midna and Midna Dark both create a complete unified look from boot-up all the way through logout.</p>

    <p>This ISO uses the <b>CRC and finobt enabled</b> XFS filesystem as default. CRCs enable enhanced error detection due to hardware issues, whilst the format changes also improves crash recovery algorithms and the ability  of  various  tools to validate and repair metadata corruptions when they are found.  The  free  inode  btree does not index used inodes, allowing faster, more consistent inode allocation performance as filesystems age.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Octopi</strong> is becoming a very crucial part of full system maintenance for KaOS. It is not just a GUI frontend to pacman. Tools like making sure a mirror is synced before starting any update, looking at the pacman logs, an option to get a paste from a complete snapshot of all info of a system with the SysInfo tool are included. Also included are very simple ways to open files, like copy to clipboard the file path shown in Octopi. To make sure the system doesn't start using too much disk space for the pacman cache, but still giving the user the option to retain some recent packages, the cache-cleaner tool is a great addition. The built-in tool to access <a href="https://github.com/KaOS-Community-Packages">KCP</a> has now a much clearer place with the addition of its own "foreign" icon in the menu-bar. When viewing package info it is now possible to click the depends of such a package. New added is the option to select custom icons for the systemtray.</p>
    
    <p>For UEFI installs, KaOS uses the simple, transparent but quite powerful systemd-boot as bootloader.</p>
    
    <p>To learn more about the goals and ideas behind KaOS, please read the <a href="http://kaosx.us/">Home</a>, <a href="http://kaosx.us/about/">About</a> and <a href="http://kaosx.us/faq/">FAQ</a> pages.</p>
    
    <p>To avoid any misunderstanding and confusion, KaOS is <b>not based upon, derived of, or inspired by</b> any one particular distribution. It is completely independent, build entirely from scratch with its own repositories. To read more about this see <a href="http://kaosx.us/about/based/">FAQ</a>. A <b>rolling release distribution</b> never has a "final" release, every ISO is merely a snapshot of the current status of the repositories. An idea what is currently available:</p>
    
    <p>The ISO ships with <b>Frameworks 5.98.0, Plasma 5.25.90, KDE Applications 22.08.1</b>, Linux 5.19.13, Systemd 251.5, Kmod 30, NetworkManager 1.40.0, LibreOffice 7.4.1, Elisa, Xorg-Server 1.21.4, Mesa 22.1.7, Glibc 2.35, GCC 11.3.0, non-free Nvidia 515 and Python3 3.9.14 to name a few.</p>
    
    <p>The package manager is <strong>Pacman 6.0.1</strong>, with the simple but powerful Octopi 0.14 as GUI frontend. Default web browser is Qt based Falkon. <b>GFXboot</b> is included with KaOS artwork, Grub theme is Midna, Look &amp; Feel is a KaOS exclusive version "Midna".</p>
    
    <p><b>Repositories</b> of KaOS will stay limited in size and expect it to stay at the current maximum of about 2100-2200. A gist of what is available, besides the stable kernel there is Linux-next 6.0, Calligra 3.2.1, VLC, Vokoscreen, Blender, Kodi, Calibre, Sigil, Vulkan packages, a few games like 0ad and Knights.<br />
    A limited number of the most well-known GTK applications are available, examples Firefox 105.0.2, Chrome 108, Ardour 6.9.0, Inkscape 1.2.1, GIMP 2.99.12 and Thunderbird 102.3.<br />
    Complete language packs are available for KDE, Calligra, Firefox, LibreOffice and Thunderbird. For IM, Fcitx 4.2.9.9 is available as a rather complete group.</p>
    
    <p><b>Known issues:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>ZFS filesystems installs will encounter a boot problem once their new installed system regenerates the kernel image. Add <code>zfs_force=1</code> to the kernel line to be able to boot, see the <a href="https://forum.kaosx.us/d/2990-zfs-boot-issue-after-kernel-image-regeneration">Forum News Post</a> for more.</li>
        <li>Installing on RAID is currently not possible</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>To create <b>reliable</b> installation media, please follow the instructions from the <a href="http://kaosx.us/download/">Download</a> page. KaOS's ISO's <b>do not support unetbootin or rufus</b>, and DVDs need a burn speed <b>no higher than 4x</b>.</p>
