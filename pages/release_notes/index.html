<h3>KaOS - 2021.01</h3>
    <p>Two weeks into the New Year, KaOS is pleased to present you with a first ISO for 2021</p>
            
    <p>For the many changes in this release, a few stand out. This is a first ISO that ships with <strong>Qt 6</strong>. Not that Plasma is ready for Qt 6, but some are (Poppler, Strawberry, Qsynth, Qtkeychain for example), so to get this distribution in good shape for the eventual Qt 6 move, any that can be built with Qt 6 are done so now.</br>
    The <strong>KDE Applications release 20.12</strong> saw the addition of almost a dozen new applications, some just moved from standalone releases to now a monthly release, but the addition of Itinerary (an app that provides you with all the information you need while on the road) and Spectacle using Kimageannotator for annotation tool are good improvements.</br>
    There has been a search for quite some time for a good GUI to handle Systemd services, the used systemd-kcm has not been maintained for years. This replacement is now found and included in the ISO, <strong>Stacer</strong> (it can also be used as a system clean-up tool and handle startup applications).</p>
    
    <p>As always with this rolling distribution, you will find the very latest packages for the Plasma Desktop, this includes Frameworks 5.78.0, Plasma 5.20.5, and KDE Applications 20.12.1. All built on Qt 5.15.2.</p>
    
    <p>News for those working on KaOS (probably and hopefully not visible at all to regular users) is the migration to a new, dedicated server. This is a real hardware server, running KaOS, so no longer using a VPS. Advantage is direct access to the hardware and much more powerful specs.</p>
    
    <p>For the installer Calamares, there is now preliminary support for “split” encryption, where the boot partition is not encrypted, but the rest of the system is encrypted and the <code>users</code> module now has a more detailed way to specify user groups</p>
    
    <p>New applications added include the Matrix chat client Neochat (KDE maintained fork of Spectral), and Barrier, allowing the user to use a single keyboard and mouse to control multiple computers. New are also a PyQt 6 stack, including Sip 6, PyQt-Builder, PyQt6-sip, and PyQt 6.0.0.</p>
    
    <p>Updates to the base of this distribution were numerous and include LLVM/Clang 11 (11.0.1), Python3 3.8.7, ICU 68.2, Boost 1.75.0, Git 2.30.0, Protobuf 3.14, Hdf5 1.12.0, Poppler 21.01.0, Mesa 20.3.3, NetworkManager 1.28.0, Libarchive 3.5.1, Samba 4.13.3. The maintenance of the Linux AUFS patches has started again, so the latest kernel can be included again in the ISO, 5.10.6.</p>
    
    <p>Since LibreOffice 6.2, it is now possible to supply this as a pure Qt5/kf5 application.  LibreOffice has thus replaced Calligra as the default Office Application for KaOS.</p>
    
    <p>KaOS' creation <strong>Croeso</strong> (Welsh for welcome) for helping with configuring a new install is included.  It will run on the newly installed system and offers to adjust some 15 commonly used settings, includes a custom Wallpaper selector, distribution info and the option to select packages to install from six different groups.  It is written in QML and fits well with the Welcome application used in the Live system.  The latter includes an Installation Guide.</p>
        
    <p>There is an option to verify the authenticity of downloaded KaOS ISO files through GPG signature verification, see the Download page for further details and instructions.</p>
    
    <p>A KaOS specific tool to write ISO files to USB is in use.  Not only does IsoWriter write to USB it also gives the option to recover your USB stick after using it for an ISO, something that regular dd copy or the previously used Imagewriter were not able to do. It includes the option to verify the written USB in comparison to the used ISO file.</p>
    
    <p>The artwork includes custom icon themes for light and dark themes. Midna and Midna Dark both create a complete unified look from boot-up all the way through logout.</p>

    <p>This ISO uses the <b>CRC and finobt enabled</b> XFS filesystem as default. CRCs enable enhanced error detection due to hardware issues, whilst the format changes also improves crash recovery algorithms and the ability  of  various  tools to validate and repair metadata corruptions when they are found.  The  free  inode  btree does not index used inodes, allowing faster, more consistent inode allocation performance as filesystems age.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Octopi</strong> is becoming a very crucial part of full system maintenance for KaOS. It is not just a GUI frontend to pacman. Tools like making sure a mirror is synced before starting any update, looking at the pacman logs, an option to get a paste from a complete snapshot of all info of a system with the SysInfo tool are included. Also included are very simple ways to open files, like copy to clipboard the file path shown in Octopi. To make sure the system doesn't start using too much disk space for the pacman cache, but still giving the user the option to retain some recent packages, the cache-cleaner tool is a great addition. The built-in tool to access <a href="https://github.com/KaOS-Community-Packages">KCP</a> has now a much clearer place with the addition of its own "foreign" icon in the menu-bar. When viewing package info it is now possible to click the depends of such a package. New added is the option to select custom icons for the systemtray.</p>
    
    <p>For UEFI installs, KaOS uses the simple, transparent but quite powerful systemd-boot as bootloader.</p>
    
    <p>To learn more about the goals and ideas behind KaOS, please read the <a href="http://kaosx.us/">Home</a>, <a href="http://kaosx.us/about/">About</a> and <a href="http://kaosx.us/faq/">FAQ</a> pages.</p>
    
    <p>To avoid any misunderstanding and confusion, KaOS is <b>not based upon, derived of, or inspired by</b> any one particular distribution. It is completely independent, build entirely from scratch with its own repositories. To read more about this see <a href="http://kaosx.us/about/based/">FAQ</a>. A <b>rolling release distribution</b> never has a "final" release, every ISO is merely a snapshot of the current status of the repositories. An idea what is currently available:</p>
    
    <p>The ISO ships with <b>Frameworks 5.78.0, Plasma 5.20.5, KDE Applications 20.12.1</b>, Linux 5.10.6, Systemd 246, Kmod 28, NetworkManager 1.28.0, LibreOffice 7.0.4, Krita 4.4.1, Elisa, Xorg-Server 1.20.10, Mesa 20.3.3, Glibc 2.32, GCC 10.2.0, non-free Nvidia 460, Pepperflash and Python3 3.8.7 to name a few.</p>
    
    <p>The package manager is <strong>Pacman 5.2.2</strong>, with the simple but powerful Octopi 0.11 as GUI frontend. Default web browser is Qt based Falkon 3.1.0. <b>GFXboot</b> is included with KaOS artwork, Grub theme is Midna, Look &amp; Feel is a KaOS exclusive version "Midna".</p>
    
    <p><b>Repositories</b> of KaOS will stay limited in size and expect it to stay at the current maximum of about 2100-2200. A gist of what is available, besides the stable kernel there is Linux-next 5.10, Calligra 3.2.1, VLC, Vokoscreen, Blender, Kodi, Calibre, Sigil, Vulkan packages, a few games like 0ad and Knights.<br />
    A limited number of the most well-known GTK applications are available, examples Firefox 84.0.2, Chrome 89, Ardour 6.5.0, Inkscape 1.0.1, GIMP 2.10.22 and Thunderbird 78.6.1.<br />
    Complete language packs are available for KDE, Calligra, Firefox, LibreOffice and Thunderbird. For IM, Fcitx 4.2.9.6 is available as a rather complete group.</p>
    
    <p><b>Known issues:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Installing on RAID is currently not possible</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>To create <b>reliable</b> installation media, please follow the instructions from the <a href="http://kaosx.us/download/">Download</a> page. KaOS's ISO's <b>do not support unetbootin or rufus</b>, and DVDs need a burn speed <b>no higher than 4x</b>.</p>
