<h3>KaOS - 2017.06</h3>
    <p>KaOS is pleased to announce the 2017.06 release.</p>
    
    <p>Just days after Qt 5.9.0 and Plasma 5.10.0 where announced, can you already see both on this new release. Highlights of Plasma 5.10.0 include Task Manager gaining options for middle mouse click such as grouping and ungrouping applications, media controls on lock screen, revamped password dialogs for network authentication, performance optimizations in Pager and Task Manager, the security of the lock screen architecture was reworked and simplified and file copying notifications have a context menu on previews.</p>
    
    <p>For those who do not want to build packages they miss from the repositories the option to use Flatpaks has been added to KaOS. Discover is added as the GUI for Flatpak.</p>
    
    <p>Plasma developers are working on two new Music Players, now included in the KaOS repositories are both. Babe has become the default player on this ISO, Elisa is available as another option. Other recent additions include a GUI for git QGit and QDirStat, a graphical application to show where your disk space has gone.</p>
    
    <p>A new option is the addition to verify the authenticity of downloaded KaOS ISO files through GPG signature verification, see the Download page for further details and instructions.</p>
    
    <p>As always with this rolling distribution, you will find the very latest packages for the Plasma Desktop, this includes Frameworks 5.34.0, Plasma 5.10.0, KDE Applications 17.04.1 &amp; <strong>not yet released ports of KDE Applications.</strong> All built on <strong> Qt 5.9.0.</strong></p>
    
    <p>A KaOS specific tool to write ISO files to USB is in use.  Not only does IsoWriter write to USB it also gives the option to recover your USB stick after using it for an ISO, something that regular dd copy or the previously used Imagewriter were not able to do. It includes the option to verify the written USB in comparison to the used ISO file.</p>
    
    <p>Mesa includes experimental Nouveau patches so QtWebengine based applications and web-browsers can again be used on systems running the Nouveau driver.  This fixes a long standing bug going back to the middle of 2015.</p>
    
    <p>KaOS uses a First Run Wizard.  It will run on the newly installed system and enables with just a few clicks to adjust mouse behavior, menu launcher, desktop theme, used wallpaper, color scheme, widget style, window decoration and virtual desktops used.  With one click this Wizard will also link to KaOS Documentation and all contact info.</p>
    
    <p>Most notable major updates to the base of the system are Qt 5.9.0, Boost 1.63.0, Glib2 2.52.2, Kmod 24, Mesa 17.1.1, x265 2.4, FFMpeg 3.3, DBus 1.10.18, Protobuf 3.3.1, PyQt 5.8.2 and a move to qtwebkit-tp replacing no longer maintained qt5-webkit</p>
    
    <p>KaOS repositories no longer provide Qt 4.  It is a good three years ago that development for Qt 4 stopped, late 2015 all support including security fixes ended.  Any application that has not made the transition to Qt 5 in all this time can no longer be supported in KaOS.  Either they actually are no longer maintained or their development is ignoring the implications of building on a possible insecure toolkit.</p>
    
    <p>The artwork includes custom icon themes for light and dark themes. Midna and Midna Dark both create a complete unified look from boot-up all the way through logout.</p>

    <p>This ISO uses the <b>CRC and finobt enabled</b> XFS filesystem as default. CRCs enable enhanced error detection due to hardware issues, whilst the format changes also improves crash recovery algorithms and the ability  of  various  tools to validate and repair metadata corruptions when they are found.  The  free  inode  btree does not index used inodes, allowing faster, more consistent inode allocation performance as filesystems age.</p>

    <p><b><a title="Calamares" href="http://calamares.github.io/about">Calamares</a></b>, the used installer framework, has moved to the 3.1 series. Highlights of the changes and additions:
    <ul>
        <li>Fixed Hibernate on LUKS enabled swap partitions</li>
        <li>Option to use a GPT partiontable on BIOS system with needed documentation added</li>
        <li>When a VirtualBox system is detected, proper Guest Modules will be installed</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue in the partition module to always set the correct flags for an EFI system partition</li>
    </ul></p>
    
    <p><strong>Octopi</strong> is becoming a very crucial part of full system maintenance for KaOS. It is not just a GUI frontend to pacman. Tools like making sure a mirror is synced before starting any update, looking at the pacman logs, an option to get a paste from a complete snapshot of all info of a system with the SysInfo tool are included. Also included are very simple ways to open files, like copy to clipboard the file path shown in Octopi. To make sure the system doesn't start using too much disk space for the pacman cache, but still giving the user the option to retain some recent packages, the cache-cleaner tool is a great addition. The built-in tool to access <a href="https://github.com/KaOS-Community-Packages">KCP</a> has now a much clearer place with the addition of its own "foreign" icon in the menu-bar. When viewing package info it is now possible to click the depends of such a package. New added is the option to select custom icons for the systemtray.</p>
    
    <p>For UEFI installs, KaOS uses the simple, transparent but quite powerful systemd-boot as bootloader.</p>
    
    <p>To learn more about the goals and ideas behind KaOS, please read the <a href="http://kaosx.us/">Home</a>, <a href="http://kaosx.us/about/">About</a> and <a href="http://kaosx.us/faq/">FAQ</a> pages.</p>
    
    <p>To avoid any misunderstanding and confusion, KaOS is <b>not based upon, derived of, or inspired by</b> any one particular distribution. It is completely independent, build entirely from scratch with its own repositories. To read more about this see <a href="http://kaosx.us/about/based/">FAQ</a>. A <b>rolling release distribution</b> never has a "final" release, every ISO is mere a snapshot of the current status of the repositories. An idea what is currently available:</p>
    
    <p>The ISO ships with <b>Frameworks 5.34.0, Plasma 5.10.0, KDE Applications 17.04.1 &amp; not yet released ports of KDE Applications</b>, Linux 4.10.9, Systemd 233, Kmod 24, NetworkManager 1.8.0, Calligra 3.0.1, Krita 3.1.4, Babe, Xorg-Server 1.19.3, Mesa 17.1.1, Glibc 2.25, GCC 5.4.1, non-free Nvidia 381.22, Pepperflash and Python3 3.6.1 to name a few.</p>
    
    <p>The package manager is <strong>Pacman 5.0.1</strong>, with the simple but powerful Octopi 0.9dev as GUI frontend. Default web browser is Qt based Qupzilla 2.1.1. <b>GFXboot</b> is included with KaOS artwork, Grub theme is Midna, Look &amp; Feel is a KaOS exclusive version "Midna", fully redone for 2017.</p>
    
    <p><b>Repositories</b> of KaOS will stay limited in size and expect it to stay at the current maximum of about 2100-2200. A gist of what is available, besides the stable kernel there is Linux-next 4.11, Libreoffice 5.3.3, bumblebee packages, VLC, Vokoscreen, Blender, XBMC, Calibre, Sigil, Librecad, a few games like 0ad and Knights.<br />
    A limited number of the most well-known GTK applications are available, examples Firefox 53.0.2, Chrome 60, Ardour 5.9.0, Inkscape 0.92.1, GIMP 2.9.4 and Google-talkplugin 5.42.3.0.1.<br />
    Complete language packs are available for KDE, Calligra, Firefox, Libreoffice and Thunderbird. For IM, Fcitx 4.2.9.1 is available as a rather complete group.</p>
    
    <p><b>Known issues:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Installing on RAID or LVM is currently not possible</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>To create <b>reliable</b> installation media, please follow the instructions from the <a href="http://kaosx.us/download/">Download</a> page. KaOS's ISO's <b>do not support unetbootin or rufus</b>, and DVDs need a burn speed <b>no higher than 4x</b>.</p>
