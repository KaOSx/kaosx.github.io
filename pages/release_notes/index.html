<h3>KaOS - 2018.10</h3>
    <p>KaOS is pleased to announce the October release of a new stable ISO.</p>
    
    <p>Plasma 5.14.0 was just announced and is already included in this ISO. Highlights of this version include a new Display Configuration widget for screen management which is useful for presentations, the Audio Volume widget now has a built in speaker test feature moved from Phonon settings, Plasma now warns on logout when other users are logged in, fixed non-centered task switchers on Wayland and the Kickoff application menu now switches tabs instantly on hover.</p>
    
    <p>A new Glibc 2.27/GCC 7.3.1 based toolchain is among the many changes to the base of the system. Updates to Boost, ICU, x265, Protobuf, Net-snmp, Qt required the rebuild of a large percentage of the KaOS repositories.</p>
    
    <p>As always with this rolling distribution, you will find the very latest packages for the Plasma Desktop, this includes Frameworks 5.51.0, Plasma 5.14.0 and KDE Applications 18.08.2. </strong>All built on <strong> Qt 5.11.2.</strong></p>
    
    <p>KaOS' creation <strong>Croeso</strong> (Welsh for welcome) for helping with configuring a new install is included.  It will run on the newly installed system and offers to adjust some 15 commonly used settings and replaces the formerly used, PyQt based first run wizard Kaptan.  It also includes a custom Wallpaper selector, distribution info and news.  It is written in QML and fits well with the Welcome application used in the Live system.  The latter now includes a fully rewritten (also in QML) Installation Guide.</p>
        
    <p>There is an option to verify the authenticity of downloaded KaOS ISO files through GPG signature verification, see the Download page for further details and instructions.</p>
    
    <p>A KaOS specific tool to write ISO files to USB is in use.  Not only does IsoWriter write to USB it also gives the option to recover your USB stick after using it for an ISO, something that regular dd copy or the previously used Imagewriter were not able to do. It includes the option to verify the written USB in comparison to the used ISO file.</p>
    
    <p>Most notable major updates to the base of the system are Glibc 2.27 , GCC 7.3.1, Linux 4.18.12, Boost 1.68.0, Wayland 1.16.0, Gstreamer 1.14.4, ICU 62.1, Systemd 239, Mesa 18.2.2, NetworkManager 1.14.0, Rust 1.29.1, Nano 3.1, Bison 3.1, Apache 2.4.35 and Qt 5.11.2</p>
    
    <p>KaOS repositories no longer provide Qt 4.  It is a good three years ago that development for Qt 4 stopped, late 2015 all support including security fixes ended.  Any application that has not made the transition to Qt 5 in all this time can no longer be supported in KaOS.  Either they actually are no longer maintained or their development is ignoring the implications of building on a possible insecure toolkit.</p>
    
    <p>The artwork includes custom icon themes for light and dark themes. Midna and Midna Dark both create a complete unified look from boot-up all the way through logout. There was a complete redesign of the Midna theme for 2018. Some 2500 new icons in use, rewritten sddm login theme and a KaOS community selected new wallpaper (created by Jomada).</p>

    <p>This ISO uses the <b>CRC and finobt enabled</b> XFS filesystem as default. CRCs enable enhanced error detection due to hardware issues, whilst the format changes also improves crash recovery algorithms and the ability  of  various  tools to validate and repair metadata corruptions when they are found.  The  free  inode  btree does not index used inodes, allowing faster, more consistent inode allocation performance as filesystems age.</p>

    <p><b><a title="Calamares" href="http://calamares.github.io/about">Calamares</a></b>, the used installer framework, has moved to 3.2 series. Highlights of the changes and additions:
    <ul>
        <li>The partition module supports RAID devices, but only when Calamares is compiled with the newest KPMCore release. </li>
        <li>The keyboard module now handles the (bogus) Austrian keymap for the system console properly.</li>
        <li>UI annoyances in the partitioning module were fixed; the mount-point selector is now more obvious when no mount-point has been chosen, and the mount-point and flags are preserved when (re)editing partitions.</li>
        <li>Various off-by-one-sector errors in the automatic partitioning mode have been corrected. In addition, swap space is calculated a little more conservatively.</li>
        <li>The search paths for QML files, branding descriptors and module descriptors have been revamped and now self-document in the log.</li>
    </ul></p>
    
    <p><strong>Octopi</strong> is becoming a very crucial part of full system maintenance for KaOS. It is not just a GUI frontend to pacman. Tools like making sure a mirror is synced before starting any update, looking at the pacman logs, an option to get a paste from a complete snapshot of all info of a system with the SysInfo tool are included. Also included are very simple ways to open files, like copy to clipboard the file path shown in Octopi. To make sure the system doesn't start using too much disk space for the pacman cache, but still giving the user the option to retain some recent packages, the cache-cleaner tool is a great addition. The built-in tool to access <a href="https://github.com/KaOS-Community-Packages">KCP</a> has now a much clearer place with the addition of its own "foreign" icon in the menu-bar. When viewing package info it is now possible to click the depends of such a package. New added is the option to select custom icons for the systemtray.</p>
    
    <p>For UEFI installs, KaOS uses the simple, transparent but quite powerful systemd-boot as bootloader.</p>
    
    <p>To learn more about the goals and ideas behind KaOS, please read the <a href="http://kaosx.us/">Home</a>, <a href="http://kaosx.us/about/">About</a> and <a href="http://kaosx.us/faq/">FAQ</a> pages.</p>
    
    <p>To avoid any misunderstanding and confusion, KaOS is <b>not based upon, derived of, or inspired by</b> any one particular distribution. It is completely independent, build entirely from scratch with its own repositories. To read more about this see <a href="http://kaosx.us/about/based/">FAQ</a>. A <b>rolling release distribution</b> never has a "final" release, every ISO is merely a snapshot of the current status of the repositories. An idea what is currently available:</p>
    
    <p>The ISO ships with <b>Frameworks 5.51.0, Plasma 5.14.0, KDE Applications 18.08.2</b>, Linux 4.18.12, Systemd 239, Kmod 25, NetworkManager 1.14.0, Calligra 3.1.0, Krita 4.1.5, Elisa, Xorg-Server 1.20.1, Mesa 18.2.2, Glibc 2.27, GCC 7.3.1, non-free Nvidia 396.54, Pepperflash and Python3 3.6.6 to name a few.</p>
    
    <p>The package manager is <strong>Pacman 5.1.1</strong>, with the simple but powerful Octopi 0.9dev as GUI frontend. Default web browser is Qt based Falkon 3.0.1. <b>GFXboot</b> is included with KaOS artwork, Grub theme is Midna, Look &amp; Feel is a KaOS exclusive version "Midna", fully redone for 2018.</p>
    
    <p><b>Repositories</b> of KaOS will stay limited in size and expect it to stay at the current maximum of about 2100-2200. A gist of what is available, besides the stable kernel there is Linux-next 4.18, Libreoffice 6.1.2, bumblebee packages, VLC, Vokoscreen, Blender, XBMC, Calibre, Sigil, Librecad, a few games like 0ad and Knights.<br />
    A limited number of the most well-known GTK applications are available, examples Firefox 62.0.3, Chrome 71, Ardour 5.12.0, Inkscape 0.92.2, GIMP 2.10.6 and Google-talkplugin 5.42.3.0.1.<br />
    Complete language packs are available for KDE, Calligra, Firefox, Libreoffice and Thunderbird. For IM, Fcitx 4.2.9.6 is available as a rather complete group.</p>
    
    <p><b>Known issues:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Installing on RAID or LVM is currently not possible</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>To create <b>reliable</b> installation media, please follow the instructions from the <a href="http://kaosx.us/download/">Download</a> page. KaOS's ISO's <b>do not support unetbootin or rufus</b>, and DVDs need a burn speed <b>no higher than 4x</b>.</p>
